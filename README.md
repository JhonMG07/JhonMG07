Hello! I am a Software Engineer with a strong interest in software engineering principles and high-quality development practices. I graduated from Escuela Politécnica Nacional in Quito, Ecuador, where I built a solid foundation in software development, programming languages, and modern technologies.

As a developer, I am committed to clean code, good engineering practices, and continuous learning. I have hands-on experience working with technologies such as Node.js, React.js, Java, C++, and C, as well as database management systems including SQL Server, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL.

I am passionate about software development and enjoy tackling challenging problems that allow me to grow both technically and professionally. I am actively seeking opportunities to apply my skills in impactful projects and collaborate with teams that value quality, scalability, and innovation.

Thank you for visiting my GitHub profile. I am always open to collaboration, knowledge sharing, and new challenges. Feel free to reach out if you would like to work together or have any questions.
